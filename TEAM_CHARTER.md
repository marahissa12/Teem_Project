## 2. Abdallah Jarwan – Workflow

### 2.1 Branching Model: Feature-Branch Workflow
We use a centralized Feature-Branch model to ensure stable releases:
* **`main` Branch:** Protected. Merging is allowed only via validated Pull Requests.
* **`feature/` Branches:** All development must occur in branches named `feature/[task-name]`.
* **PR Requirement:** Every change must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR) and requires **two (2) peer approvals** before merging into `main`.

### 2.2 Commit Message Standards
All commits must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification: `type(scope): description`.
* **Types:** `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug correction), `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
* **Example:** `feat(workflow): establish team roles and branching model`.

## 3. Zain ALajjouri – Clean Standards

### 3.1 Naming Conventions (Kotlin Standards)
* **Variables:** `camelCase` (descriptive names, e.g., `userRegistrationDate`).
* **Functions:** `camelCase` (verb-based, e.g., `calculateTotalScore()`).
* **Classes:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `SmartSafeLock`).
* **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`).
* **Booleans:** Prefix with `is`, `has`, or `should`.

### 3.2 Function & Code Quality
* **Single Responsibility (SRP):** Each function performs one action; otherwise, split it.
* **Limit Parameters:** Max 3 parameters; wrap extra data in a `data class` within `org.bytebloom.org.bytebloom.app.app.models/`.
* **Clean Layout:** 4-space indentation, max 120 chars per line, and logical whitespace.
* **Comments:** Explain the "Why", not the "What".

## 4. Marah Issa – Communication & SLAs

### 4.1 Communication Protocols
* **Meeting Cadence:** Daily syncs are set for **11:00 AM**, unless a critical circumstance prevents it.
* **Core Hours:** Team members are expected to be available for collaboration between **1:00 PM – 5:00 PM**.
* **Channels:** GitHub (Docs/PRs), WhatsApp (Syncs/Urgent), Google Meet (Meetings).

### 4.2 Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
* **Urgent Messages:** Response within 2 hours.
* **General Inquiries:** Response within 24 hours.
* **Pull Request Review:** Review required within **24 hours**.
* **Feedback Integration:** Requested changes addressed within **48 hours**.

### 4.3 Peer Review Checklist 
Every review must verify:
1. Code Structure/Naming.
2. IEEE-compliant documentation for complex functions.
3. Compliance with functional requirements.

## 5. Hadeel Hejazy – Architecture & .gitignore

### 5.1 Project Architecture
We follow a professional modular architecture separating business org.bytebloom.org.bytebloom.app.app.logic, data org.bytebloom.org.bytebloom.app.app.models, and entry points.

**Standard Directory Structure:**
